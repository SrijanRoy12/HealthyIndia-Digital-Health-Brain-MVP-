🍼 How to Run (Windows + Anaconda Navigator)
1️⃣ Setup Environment

Open Anaconda Navigator → Go to Environments → Click Create

Enter:

Name: health_mvp

Python version: 3.10 or 3.11

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Open a Terminal in your new health_mvp environment and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Launch the App

Still in the same terminal:

streamlit run app.py


🌐 Browser should auto-open → If not, copy the URL (usually http://localhost:8501) into Chrome.

✅ All data stays local → uploads, keys, DB, and logs live inside the data/ folder.

📂 Folder Structure

🛠 Troubleshooting

❌ Something broke?
👉 Close the terminal → Reopen → Run:
